# Work Graph Foundry

Work Graph Foundry is a local-first enterprise automation demo that finds repeated organizational patterns in messy work traces and turns them into governed AI automation. It builds a work graph, surfaces process intelligence, proposes workflow automation, validates changes against historical cases, and executes approved work in safe simulation mode.

The product is designed to be easy to evaluate in a hackathon setting. Reviewers get a polished landing page, a direct path into the demo, and a clear before-and-after story: observe work, understand the pattern, govern the proposal, and execute only what is approved. The language and flows are intentionally customer-facing, while the seeded data and local validation behavior stay reproducible for reliable judging.

## Demo Value

The demo shows how an organization can move from scattered requests and manual handoffs to governed automation without pretending the system has production access.

It highlights:

- enterprise automation for repeated internal work
- work graph modeling across people, systems, approvals, and outcomes
- process intelligence that identifies bottlenecks and recurring patterns
- governed AI automation with explicit review, simulation, and audit steps
- workflow automation that stays safe through approval-gated execution and safe simulation mode

## What The Demo Shows

The app includes two synthetic workflow scenarios:

1. IT access requests: employees request access through email, tickets, chat, approvals, and system logs.
2. Procurement intake: teams request software purchases, vendor onboarding, and invoice exception handling through intake traces, approvals, and procurement-system updates.

The default scenario is IT access requests:

1. Employees request access through email, tickets, chat, approvals, and system logs.
2. The app loads realistic multi-channel traces.
3. It normalizes messy traces into typed work items.
4. It discovers repeated access-request patterns.
5. It builds a work graph with requesters, manager approval, policy checks, IT provisioning, audit logging, exceptions, and outcomes.
6. It identifies manager approval as a bottleneck.
7. It generates a governed automation proposal.
8. It simulates that proposal against historical cases.
9. A human reviewer approves the proposal.
10. A new request runs through safe simulated actions.
11. State persists locally for replay, export, import, and reset.
12. The learning loop recommends a future improvement.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Vite 6
- Vitest
- Local TypeScript backend for the full-stack demo
- Node 24 built-in `node:sqlite`
- Local JSON-like fixture data in TypeScript
- Historical validation engine by default
- Optional server-side OpenAI Responses API proposal generation for trusted runtimes

## Run Locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run demo:dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite.

If Vite dev dependency optimization is blocked by a local sandbox, use the production artifact path:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

To run the API-backed full-stack demo:

```powershell
npm run backend:seed
npm run dev:fullstack
```

The local backend listens on `127.0.0.1:8787` by default, and the Vite app proxies `/api` to it. The generated SQLite database is stored at `.wgf/work-graph-foundry.sqlite` unless `WGF_DB_PATH` is set.

If Vite dev dependency optimization is blocked by a local sandbox, use the built full-stack server:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview:fullstack -- --port 4174
```

## Demo Path

1. Click `Launch` from the product page to open `/dashboard`.
2. Choose `IT access requests` or `Procurement intake`.
3. Click `Load Workflow`.
4. Click `Analyze` and inspect `Graph`.
5. Open `Evidence` when source traces or normalized evidence need review.
6. Click `Generate Proposal`.
7. Review required data, forbidden data, assumptions, policy checks, escalations, simulation results, and governance notes in `Review & Run`.
8. Use the `Approve` and `Reject` actions in `Review & Run`.
9. Click `Execute workflow` after approval in `Review & Run`.
10. Open `Audit` to review export/import controls and persisted audit state.
11. Use `Export Summary` in `Audit` for a portable run summary or `Reset` in `Audit` to restore seeded state.

## AI Provider Behavior

The app runs without live OpenAI credentials. The browser demo uses backend-supplied provider metadata, a compact backend status strip, and a historical validation engine fallback so it is reliable in local and judging environments.

The provider boundary is owned by the backend:

- `MockAiProvider` implements the default historical validation engine.
- `OpenAiResponsesProvider` targets the Responses API with structured JSON output.
- `server/ai.ts` reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`, optional `OPENAI_MODEL`, and optional `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- The backend sets Responses API storage to `false` for proposal generation.
- Provider mode, model, validation status, and fallback reason codes are persisted as non-secret metadata.

Do not expose `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly in browser code. The browser must not import OpenAI-capable provider code or receive keys, request headers, prompts, or raw provider errors.

To try live proposal generation locally, set the key only for the backend process:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5.5"
npm run backend:seed
npm run dev:fullstack
```

Leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset to use the historical validation engine for proposal generation.

## Full-Stack Backend Behavior

The full-stack demo includes a local backend under `server/` with `/api` routes for health, scenarios, workspace state, workflow actions, governance, execution, reset, export, import, and audit retrieval.

The backend is the primary source of truth for demo state and persists it to SQLite, while the browser keeps a small mirror for reload resilience and local test fallback. It reuses the existing deterministic domain modules for ingestion, graphing, pattern detection, simulation, governance, safe simulated execution, and learning recommendations. Proposal generation routes through the backend AI provider with historical validation fallback. Seeded organization records remain synthetic. Enterprise connectors, production auth/RBAC, real provisioning, live customer data, and browser-side secrets remain out of scope.

See [12. Full-Stack Demo Plan](docs/12-fullstack-demo-plan.md) for API routes, DB path, commands, and verification.

## Verification

Before handoff or push, run:

```powershell
npm run verify:demo
npm run verify:fullstack
```

For browser coverage, install Chromium if needed and then run the Playwright suite:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e:install
npm run test:e2e:preview
npm run test:e2e
npm run typecheck:e2e
```

Current non-browser baseline:

- Vitest suite passes
- production build passes
- audit reports 0 vulnerabilities

Current browser baseline:

- Playwright e2e exists under `tests/e2e`
- `npm run test:e2e` runs the golden demo path in Chromium
- sandboxed environments may require permission to install Chromium or launch the browser
- if Chromium launch is blocked, use `npm run verify:demo` plus `npm run build` and `npm run preview` as the fallback local check

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm run dev` fails during dependency optimization in a restricted sandbox, run `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`.
- If `npm run dev:fullstack` hits the same dependency optimization issue, run `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview:fullstack -- --port 4174`.
- If live OpenAI calls fail, leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset and use the historical validation engine.
- If the UI appears stale after changes, rebuild or reload the preview server.
- If Playwright binaries are missing, run `npm run test:e2e:install` before retrying browser tests.

## Contributing

Keep the product landing-first and reviewer-focused. Avoid turning the app into a generic chatbot or generic marketing page. New features should preserve typed contracts, reproducible demo behavior, governance visibility, and safe simulation mode by default.
