# Work Graph Foundry

Work Graph Foundry is a local-first enterprise work intelligence and governed automation demo. It observes messy work traces, builds a live work graph, identifies repeated work patterns, proposes governed automations, simulates them against historical cases, executes approved workflows through safe mock tools, and recommends improvements.

The demo opens on a customer-facing product page with a `Launch` call to action. The interactive workspace is available at `#demo` and surfaces five primary views: Overview, Evidence, Graph, Review & Run, and Audit. The Apple-inspired polish pass keeps the workflow context compact in the top bar and demotes approval, execution, export, import, and reset into the relevant `Review & Run` and `Audit` surfaces. It still shows an AI-native enterprise work loop: observe, understand, map, reason, plan, simulate, govern, execute, and improve.

The landing page is reviewer-first and hackathon-friendly: it shows a clear product claim, a compact preview of the workflow, and a direct path into the workspace without requiring a chatbot or setup ceremony.

## What The Demo Shows

The demo includes two synthetic workflow scenarios:

1. IT access requests: employees request access through email, tickets, chat, approvals, and system logs.
2. Procurement intake: teams request software purchases, vendor onboarding, and invoice exception handling through intake traces, approvals, and procurement-system updates.

The default scenario is IT access requests:

1. Employees request access through email, tickets, chat, approvals, and system logs.
2. The app loads realistic multi-channel traces.
3. It normalizes messy traces into typed work items.
4. It discovers repeated access-request patterns.
5. It builds a work graph with requesters, manager approval, policy checks, IT provisioning, audit logging, exceptions, and outcomes.
6. It identifies manager approval as a bottleneck.
7. It generates a governed automation proposal.
8. It simulates that proposal against historical cases.
9. A human reviewer approves the proposal.
10. A new request runs through safe mock tools.
11. The state persists locally for replay, export, import, and reset.
12. The learning loop recommends a future improvement.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Vite 6
- Vitest
- Local JSON-like fixture data in TypeScript
- Deterministic mock AI provider by default
- Optional OpenAI Responses API provider boundary for trusted runtimes

## Run Locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run demo:dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite.

If Vite dev dependency optimization is blocked by a local sandbox, use the production artifact path:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Demo Path

1. Click `Launch` from the product page.
2. Choose `IT access requests` or `Procurement intake`.
3. Click `Load Workflow`.
4. Click `Analyze` and inspect `Graph`.
5. Open `Evidence` when source traces or normalized evidence need review.
6. Click `Generate Proposal`.
7. Review required data, forbidden data, assumptions, policy checks, escalations, simulation results, and governance notes in `Review & Run`.
8. Use the `Approve` and `Reject` actions in `Review & Run`.
9. Click `Run approved workflow` after approval in `Review & Run`.
10. Open `Audit` to review export/import controls and persisted audit state.
11. Use `Export Summary` in `Audit` for a portable run summary or `Reset` in `Audit` to restore seeded state.

## Scripts

```powershell
npm run dev        # Start local development server
npm run demo:dev   # Start local demo server
npm run demo:seed  # Print deterministic seed state JSON
npm run demo:reset # Print browser localStorage reset snippet
npm run build      # Typecheck and build production artifact
npm run verify:demo # Run typecheck, tests, build, and audit
npm run test:e2e   # Run Playwright Chromium e2e tests
npm run preview    # Preview production build
npm run typecheck  # Run TypeScript checks
npm test           # Run Vitest suite
```

## AI Provider Behavior

The app runs without live OpenAI credentials. The browser demo uses deterministic mock agents so it is reliable in local and judging environments.

The provider boundary lives in `src/ai/providers.ts`:

- `MockAiProvider` is the default.
- `OpenAiResponsesProvider` targets the Responses API with structured JSON output.
- Live API keys should only be injected from a trusted server-side runtime.

Do not expose `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly in browser code.

## Verification

Before handoff or push, run:

```powershell
npm run verify:demo
```

For browser coverage, install Chromium if needed and then run the Playwright suite:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e:install
npm run test:e2e:preview
npm run test:e2e
npm run typecheck:e2e
```

Current non-browser baseline:

- Vitest suite passes
- production build passes
- audit reports 0 vulnerabilities

Current browser baseline:

- Playwright e2e exists under `tests/e2e`
- `npm run test:e2e` runs the golden demo path in Chromium
- sandboxed environments may require permission to install Chromium or launch the browser
- if Chromium launch is blocked, use `npm run verify:demo` plus `npm run build` and `npm run preview` as the fallback local check

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm run dev` fails during dependency optimization in a restricted sandbox, run `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`.
- If live OpenAI calls fail, leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset and use the deterministic mock provider.
- If the UI appears stale after changes, rebuild or reload the preview server.
- If Playwright binaries are missing, run `npm run test:e2e:install` before retrying browser tests.

## Contributing

Keep the product landing-first and reviewer-focused. Avoid turning the app into a generic chatbot or generic marketing page. New features should preserve typed contracts, deterministic demo behavior, governance visibility, and safe mock execution by default.
