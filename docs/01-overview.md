# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Purpose

Samruna is a local-first enterprise work intelligence and governed automation POC - Proof Of Concept. It shows how an AI-native operating layer can observe messy work traces, infer the real process, identify repeated work patterns, generate governed automation, validate that automation against history, execute approved work in safe simulation mode, and recommend improvements.

The current POC - Proof Of Concept opens with a customer-facing landing page rather than a chatbot. The first screen introduces the product and then moves into a `/dashboard` workspace with five primary views: Overview, Evidence, Graph, Review & Run, and Audit. The landing preview is intentionally explicit: three workflow blocks, a connected automation path, and an impact metrics band lead into the workspace. The workspace uses a compact topbar status strip, a progress stepper, before/after impact comparison, elevated graph metrics, collapsible technical details in Review & Run, and an execution success moment after safe execution completes. The product is meant to feel like a real enterprise tool for process owners, IT operators, compliance reviewers, and automation teams.

## 1.2 Product Problem

In large organizations, work moves through email, tickets, chat, spreadsheets, approvals, documents, and internal systems. Teams often know pieces of the process, but no one has a reliable live map of how work actually flows. This causes:

- hidden bottlenecks
- repeated manual coordination
- inconsistent approval paths
- audit gaps
- automation work that starts too late because humans first need to manually draw the workflow

Samruna demonstrates a different loop: discover the workflow from work traces first, then propose and govern automation.

## 1.3 Current State

The repository currently contains a complete local MVP:

- React/Vite/TypeScript dashboard
- seeded `it-access`, `procurement-intake`, `vendor-onboarding`, and `invoice-exceptions` fixture data
- typed domain contracts
- scenario selection and validation
- local backend API with SQLite persisted POC - Proof Of Concept state
- browser fallback mirror for reload resilience
- deterministic ingestion and normalization
- work graph generation
- pattern detection and bottleneck scoring
- governed automation proposal generation
- historical simulation
- governance approval and audit state
- safe simulation mode
- learning-loop recommendation
- run summary export/import
- Historical validation engine as the default AI provider behavior
- optional OpenAI Responses API provider boundary
- unit and component tests

The MVP is POC - Proof Of Concept-ready and does not require enterprise credentials or an OpenAI API key.

## 1.4 Main User Flow

The golden path is:

1. User clicks `Launch` from the product page.
2. User chooses a scenario.
3. User clicks `Load Workflow`.
4. App validates seeded raw work traces and shows source evidence.
5. User clicks `Analyze`.
6. App normalizes traces, builds a work graph, and detects repeated patterns.
7. User clicks `Generate Proposal` and reviews the governed automation proposal in `Review & Run`.
8. User approves or rejects the proposal.
9. User clicks `Execute workflow` after approval.
10. App executes a new request in safe simulation mode only when governance allows it.
11. User opens `Audit` to review audit events and the learning-loop improvement.
12. User exports a run summary or clicks `Reset` to restore seeded state.

## 1.5 Agentic Loop

The product demonstrates these agentic behaviors:

- Observe: read raw traces and normalize them.
- Understand: group repeated work and identify request patterns.
- Map: build the work graph.
- Reason: calculate bottlenecks, opportunity, and risk.
- Plan: generate a structured automation proposal.
- Simulate: replay historical cases before execution.
- Govern: require approval in `Review & Run` and create audit events.
- Execute: run only approved workflows through safe simulated actions from Review & Run.
- Improve: recommend a future proposal update.

## 1.6 What The Solution Is Not

The current MVP is not:

- a production connector platform
- a real provisioning system
- a general chatbot
- a workflow designer where the user draws every step
- a system that sends enterprise data to a model by default
- a multi-tenant enterprise SaaS implementation

Those are future directions, not current scope.

## 1.7 Repository Entry Points

Start with:

- `README.md` for quick setup and POC - Proof Of Concept path.
- `docs/02-architecture.md` for how the app is built.
- `docs/03-development.md` for how to continue development.
- `docs/06-testing-and-validation.md` for test and agentic verification steps.
- `docs/10-demo-operations.md` for the operator runbook.

Important source files:

- `src/App.tsx`: dashboard orchestration.
- `server/workspace.ts`: backend workspace state, seed/reset, import/export, and API-backed action flow.
- `src/domain/types.ts`: shared contracts.
- `src/domain/persistence.ts`: versioned POC - Proof Of Concept state export/import and browser fallback mirror.
- `src/fixtures/demoData.ts`: seeded synthetic scenario data.
- `src/ai/providers.ts`: mock and optional OpenAI provider boundary.

## 1.8 Current POC - Proof Of Concept Story

The default story centers on `it-access`:

- Employees request application access.
- Requests arrive through several channels.
- The process usually requires manager approval.
- Standard requests are repeatable.
- Privileged, contractor, finance, or exception cases need human review.
- The system discovers this pattern, proposes an automation, validates it against historical cases, and executes only after governance approval.

The strongest POC - Proof Of Concept moment is that the workflow is discovered from traces rather than predefined by the user.

The other scenarios, `procurement-intake`, `vendor-onboarding`, and `invoice-exceptions`, demonstrate that the same domain pipeline and local backend can handle adjacent enterprise workflows without a live connector. They keep low-risk intake on a candidate fast path while onboarding and exception handling remain human-reviewed.
