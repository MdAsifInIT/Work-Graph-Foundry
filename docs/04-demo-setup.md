# 4. Demo Setup

## 4.1 Requirements

Required:

- Node.js compatible with the installed package versions.
- npm.
- Local browser.
- No external services.
- No OpenAI API key.
- No enterprise credentials.

Optional:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for future trusted server-side integration. The current browser demo does not use it.

## 4.2 Local Run Steps

Install:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the local demo server:

```powershell
npm run demo:dev
```

Open the printed local URL.

Fallback production path:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Use this fallback if Vite dev optimization is blocked by the environment.

Install Playwright Chromium if the local machine has not already done so:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e:install
```

Use `npm run test:e2e:preview` for the preview-backed Playwright path and `npm run typecheck:e2e` for the e2e TypeScript project.

## 4.3 Demo Walkthrough

### 4.3.1 Open The Dashboard

Start with the dashboard. Explain that Work Graph Foundry begins from traces, not a manually designed workflow.

Point out:

- scenario selector
- `Load Scenario`
- `Analyze`
- `Generate Proposal`
- `Approve` and `Reject`
- `Run Mock`
- `Export Summary`
- `Reset`
- deterministic mock AI mode
- governed execution state

### 4.3.2 Choose A Scenario

Use `IT access requests` for the default story. Use `Procurement intake` to show the same engine on software purchase, vendor onboarding, and invoice exception traces.

All names, tickets, vendors, systems, approvals, and amounts are synthetic.

### 4.3.3 Load Scenario Data

Click `Load Scenario`.

Explain:

"The scenario data represents work spread across email, tickets, chat, approval logs, and system actions."

Show raw traces, cases, policies, approvals, and source channel counts.

### 4.3.4 Analyze Workflow

Click `Analyze`.

Show normalized items, warnings, top system, and raw-to-normalized evidence.

Explain:

"The system converts messy traces into canonical work items with requester, department, request type, system, status, and source links."

This is the observe step.

### 4.3.5 Show The Work Graph

Explain:

"The work graph shows the process path: requester, manager approval, policy check, system action, audit log, exception review, and outcome."

This is the map step.

### 4.3.6 Show Pattern Detection

Explain:

"The system discovers repeated workflow patterns and identifies manager approval as a bottleneck."

This is the understand and reason step.

### 4.3.7 Generate The Proposal

Click `Generate Proposal`.

Explain:

"The planner generates a structured automation proposal with trigger, required data, rules, actions, escalations, confidence, risk, expected value, audit rationale, and assumptions."

This is the plan step.

### 4.3.8 Show Simulation And Governance

Explain:

"The proposal is replayed against historical cases before it can run."

Point out pass, needs-human, policy-risk, avoided delay, governance/security notes, and blocked execution gate.

This is the simulate step.

### 4.3.9 Approve Or Reject

Click `Approve`.

Explain:

"Approval creates an audit event and opens the execution gate for this proposal version."

Optional branch: click `Reject` to show that the execution gate remains blocked.

This is the govern step.

### 4.3.10 Run Mock Execution

Click `Run Mock`.

Explain:

"The new request runs through safe mock tools. No real enterprise system is changed."

This is the execute step.

### 4.3.11 Show Learning And Audit

Explain:

"The learning loop recommends splitting exception-heavy cases into a human-review lane."

Show the persisted audit trail and exported run summary. Explain that the summary is portable demo state, not production evidence.

This is the improve step.

## 4.4 Reset And Recovery

Click `Reset` to replay the demo. Reset clears generated local state for the selected scenario and writes a deterministic seeded baseline back to browser localStorage.

Seed state helper:

```powershell
npm run demo:seed
npm run demo:seed -- procurement-intake
```

Browser reset snippet helper:

```powershell
npm run demo:reset
npm run demo:reset -- procurement-intake
```

If the app appears stale:

1. Refresh the browser.
2. Click `Reset`.
3. Restart the dev or preview server.
4. Rebuild with `npm run build`.

If live AI is unavailable:

Use the default mock mode. The demo is designed for this.

## 4.5 Presenter Talk Track

Short version:

"Work Graph Foundry observes how work actually moves, builds a live graph, finds repeated patterns and bottlenecks, proposes governed automation, simulates it against history, requires human approval, executes safely through mock tools, persists the audit trail locally, and learns from exceptions."

For a shorter hackathon talk track and the exact browser fallback path, see [Hackathon Demo](11-hackathon-demo.md).

## 4.6 Demo Acceptance Checklist

Before presenting:

- `npm run verify:demo` passes for non-browser verification.
- `npm run test:e2e` passes when browser launch is allowed.
- `npm run build` passes.
- `npm test` passes.
- `Load Scenario` renders source counts.
- `Analyze` renders normalized evidence, graph, and patterns.
- `Generate Proposal` renders proposal, simulation, and governance notes.
- `Approve` opens the execution gate.
- `Reject` keeps the execution gate blocked.
- `Run Mock` shows mock tool calls.
- Learning recommendation appears.
- `Export Summary` produces JSON.
- `Reset` restores seeded demo state.
- No API key is required.
- Mobile layout has no horizontal overflow.

If `npm run test:e2e` cannot launch Chromium in a sandboxed environment, request browser-launch permission or record the permission blocker in the handoff. Do not treat missing permission as a product failure.
