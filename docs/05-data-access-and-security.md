# 5. Data Access And Security

## 5.1 Required Organization Access

The current MVP requires no organization access.

It does not connect to:

- email systems
- ticketing systems
- chat systems
- identity providers
- HR systems
- provisioning systems
- document repositories
- databases

All demo data is seeded locally in `src/fixtures/demoData.ts`.

## 5.2 What Data The Solution Needs In A Real Deployment

A production version would need read access to work traces such as:

- ticket records
- email metadata or approved message excerpts
- chat thread metadata or approved excerpts
- approval logs
- identity and employment status
- application catalog metadata
- policy catalog metadata
- provisioning task history
- audit events

The system does not need unrestricted access to every document or message. It needs scoped work-trace data with provenance.

## 5.3 What The MVP Uses Today

The MVP uses local fixture fields:

- requester name
- department
- manager or approver
- target system
- request type
- urgency
- timestamps
- policy flags
- exceptions
- outcome
- raw trace text
- source channel

This data is fictional and committed as demo fixtures.

## 5.4 What It Does Not Need

For the MVP, the solution does not need:

- passwords
- API keys
- customer production data
- employee private inbox access
- full chat history
- financial records
- HR personnel files
- real provisioning permissions
- write access to enterprise systems

For production, the solution should still avoid broad access. Use scoped connectors, least privilege, and source-specific retention rules.

## 5.5 Security Model In The MVP

Current safety controls:

- no live enterprise connectors
- no real write actions
- no browser-side secret usage
- deterministic mock AI provider by default
- typed proposal contract
- simulation before execution
- approval gate before execution
- audit event generation
- mock tool calls only

## 5.6 OpenAI And Data Handling

The browser demo does not send data to OpenAI.

`OpenAiResponsesProvider` exists as an integration boundary for trusted runtimes. A production integration should:

1. run server-side
2. own `OPENAI_API_KEY` securely
3. send only necessary fields
4. validate model output
5. log model-influenced decisions
6. fall back safely if the model call fails

## 5.7 Governance Controls

The product models governance as a first-class state:

- proposals have versions
- reviewers make decisions
- comments are recorded
- audit events are generated
- execution is blocked until approval exists

This is important because enterprise automation must be reviewable before it changes operational behavior.

## 5.8 Common Security And Compliance Questions

### 5.8.1 Does the MVP access real company systems?

No. It uses local fixture data only.

### 5.8.2 Does the MVP require an OpenAI API key?

No. The default provider is deterministic mock behavior.

### 5.8.3 Does the browser app expose secrets?

No. The docs explicitly prohibit exposing `OPENAI_API_KEY` in browser code.

### 5.8.4 Does the app perform real provisioning?

No. Execution creates mock tool call records only.

### 5.8.5 Can automation run before approval?

No. The execution gate checks governance records before running.

### 5.8.6 What data would a production connector need?

Only scoped work-trace data needed to reconstruct process flow: source metadata, timestamps, participants, status changes, approvals, policies, systems, exceptions, and outcomes.

### 5.8.7 Does the system need full email or chat history?

No. A production system should use scoped access, approved channels, filters, or exported traces. Broad mailbox or chat history access is not required for the product concept.

### 5.8.8 How are compliance reviewers represented?

The MVP represents them through governance records, reviewer roles, comments, proposal versions, and audit events.

### 5.8.9 What happens to high-risk cases?

Simulation classifies privileged or policy-sensitive cases as human-review or policy-risk paths. The planner includes escalations rather than straight-through automation.

### 5.8.10 How should data retention work in production?

Retention should be configurable by source and policy. Store enough provenance for auditability, but avoid retaining unnecessary raw content.

## 5.9 Production Security Checklist

Before productionizing:

- add authentication
- add role-based access control
- add connector-level least privilege
- add server-side secret management
- add persistent immutable audit logs
- add proposal versioning
- add model call logging
- add data retention policy
- add tool execution allowlists
- add approval policies per workflow risk level
