# 7. Roadmap

## 7.1 Current Limitations

The MVP is intentionally scoped. Current limitations:

- no authentication
- no role-based access control
- no live enterprise connectors
- no real provisioning
- no production-hosted OpenAI deployment, eval suite, or live-key CI path
- no production-grade multi-user database or immutable audit store
- no richer visual graph canvas beyond the current selectable graph/pattern inspection
- limited browser automation coverage beyond the current Chromium golden path

These limitations are acceptable for a local-first POC - Proof Of Concept but should be addressed before production use.

## 7.2 Near-Term Local POC Needs

Recommended local POC improvements:

1. Expand Playwright e2e beyond the current Chromium golden path.
2. Add mobile viewport e2e coverage for the full POC - Proof Of Concept path.
3. Add accessibility checks for keyboard navigation, labels, focus order, and contrast.
4. Add CI coverage for typecheck, unit tests, build, audit, and Playwright.
5. Add a richer visual graph canvas.
6. Add more workflow templates.
7. Add dataset import beyond the current run-summary import/export.

## 7.3 Production-Only Roadmap

Production-ready next steps:

1. Harden the server-side OpenAI path with evals, red-team fixtures, and production deployment controls.
2. Add production-grade durable storage for traces, proposals, simulations, governance records, execution runs, and audit events.
3. Add authentication and role-based access control.
4. Add connector framework for enterprise systems.
5. Add observability for model calls and execution outcomes.

## 7.4 Server-Side OpenAI Integration

A production-ready OpenAI integration should extend the existing backend-only proposal and synthetic execution generation flow and:

- live outside browser code
- own `OPENAI_API_KEY` securely
- call the Responses API
- validate structured output
- log model-influenced decisions
- fall back to the Historical validation engine on failure

The current local backend already owns proposal generation. Production work should focus on deployment controls, evals, observability, and live-key CI rather than moving model calls into the browser.

## 7.5 Enterprise Connector Roadmap

Potential connectors:

- ticketing systems
- email systems
- chat systems
- identity providers
- HR systems
- provisioning tools
- document repositories
- audit systems

Connector principles:

- least privilege
- scoped sync
- provenance preservation
- source-specific retention
- no write actions without approval

## 7.6 Workflow Expansion

Implemented local scenarios:

- IT access requests
- Procurement intake
- Vendor onboarding
- Invoice exceptions

Good next workflows:

### 7.6.1 Employee Onboarding

Flow:

- HR trigger
- IT access
- device provisioning
- payroll setup
- security training

Why it fits:

- cross-functional
- graph-friendly
- clear orchestration value

### 7.6.2 Incident Triage

Flow:

- alert intake
- severity classification
- owner assignment
- customer communication
- remediation tracking

Why it fits:

- time-sensitive
- strong escalation model
- clear human-review boundary

### 7.6.3 Finance Exceptions

Flow:

- invoice exception
- missing purchase order
- manager review
- finance approval
- audit note

Why it fits:

- measurable delays
- strong governance requirements
- clear human-review lane

## 7.7 Productionization Path

Suggested order:

1. Harden the local POC - Proof Of Concept with expanded e2e, mobile, accessibility, and CI checks.
2. Add a richer graph visualization that preserves provenance and bottleneck inspection.
3. Harden the existing backend API contracts for authenticated multi-user use.
4. Replace local SQLite with production-grade durable storage and immutable audit retention.
5. Add authentication.
6. Add RBAC.
7. Add OpenAI evals, red-team fixtures, and production live-key deployment controls.
8. Add connector ingestion.
9. Add tool execution allowlists.
10. Add deployment configuration.

## 7.8 Security Roadmap

Security work should include:

- secret management
- audit immutability
- scoped connector permissions
- data retention controls
- model input/output logging
- approval policies by risk level
- secure tool execution
- incident review for failed automations

## 7.9 Testing Roadmap

Add:

- more Playwright flows for scenario switching, import/export, reset recovery, governance rejection, and execution gating
- mobile viewport Playwright coverage
- accessibility checks in local and CI verification
- CI jobs for `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm audit --audit-level=low`, and `npm run test:e2e`
- imported fixture schema tests
- provider fallback tests
- connector contract tests
- server route tests
- visual regression checks for the dashboard

Current browser command:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e
```

Install Chromium first if needed:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e:install
```

Use `npm run test:e2e:preview` for the preview-backed Playwright path and `npm run typecheck:e2e` when validating the e2e TypeScript project.

Sandboxed environments may require explicit permission to install browsers or launch Chromium.

## 7.10 Definition Of Production Readiness

The product is production-ready only when:

- real connectors are scoped and audited
- secrets are server-side only
- audit events persist immutably
- RBAC protects proposal approval and execution
- tool actions are allowlisted
- high-risk cases require human review
- model output is validated
- monitoring captures failures and overrides
- deployment and rollback are documented
