# 10. Demo Operations

## 10.1 Local Demo Command

Start the demo:

```powershell
npm run demo:dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite.

Production-preview fallback:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 10.2 Scenarios

Available scenarios:

- `IT access requests`: default access-request workflow with manager approval bottleneck, policy checks, provisioning mock, and audit logging.
- `Procurement intake`: software procurement, vendor onboarding, and invoice exception workflow with procurement, finance, legal, and policy review paths.

All scenario data is synthetic and stored in `src/fixtures/demoData.ts`.

## 10.3 Golden Path

1. Select `IT access requests`.
2. Click `Load Scenario`.
3. Click `Analyze`.
4. Inspect evidence, graph, patterns, and bottleneck.
5. Click `Generate Proposal`.
6. Review required data, AI assumptions, policy checks, actions, escalations, simulation, and governance notes.
7. Click `Approve`.
8. Confirm execution gate is `Open`.
9. Click `Run Mock`.
10. Confirm mock tool calls and learning recommendation.
11. Click `Export Summary`.
12. Click `Reset`.
13. Switch to `Procurement intake` and repeat load, analyze, and proposal generation.

## 10.4 Reset And Seed

Normal operator reset:

- Click `Reset` in the app.

Seed helper:

```powershell
npm run demo:seed
npm run demo:seed -- procurement-intake
```

Browser reset snippet helper:

```powershell
npm run demo:reset
npm run demo:reset -- procurement-intake
```

The CLI helper prints deterministic JSON or a browser-console localStorage snippet. The app itself owns the normal reset path because the persisted state lives in the browser profile.

## 10.5 Import And Export

`Export Summary` writes JSON to the dashboard textbox. It includes:

- selected scenario
- staged operator flags
- generated graph
- proposal
- governance records
- simulation
- execution result
- recommendation
- audit events

`Import Summary` restores a previously exported Work Graph Foundry run summary pasted into the import textbox.

Do not commit exported run summaries unless they are intentionally added as synthetic documentation examples.

## 10.6 Safety Notes

- The default AI provider is deterministic mock behavior.
- The browser demo does not need `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Live OpenAI calls, if added later, must be server-side only.
- Mock execution never mutates external systems.
- The demo does not need passwords, raw secrets, private message bodies, production write access, or unrestricted admin access.

## 10.7 Recovery

If the UI looks stale:

1. Click `Reset`.
2. Refresh the browser.
3. Restart `npm run demo:dev`.
4. Use `npm run build` and `npm run preview` as a fallback.

If tests or build fail, run:

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Fix deterministic domain failures before changing the UI.
