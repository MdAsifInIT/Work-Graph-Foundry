# 11. Hackathon Demo

## 11.1 What "Production-Ready For A Hackathon" Means

For this repository, hackathon-ready means the demo is:

- local-first and self-contained
- deterministic by default
- safe to run without external services
- easy to rehearse in one browser session
- clear about what is real versus mocked
- verified with a short, repeatable command set

It does not mean the product is production-ready for enterprise use.

## 11.2 Safe Local Behavior Today

The current demo is safe for local and hackathon use because:

- the default AI provider is deterministic mock behavior
- the scenario data is synthetic
- no `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required
- execution uses mock tools only
- approvals and audit state stay inside browser localStorage
- reset, seed, import, and export are local operations

## 11.3 Real Production Still Requires

Before real production use, the product still needs:

- a server-side API layer
- server-side secret handling
- durable storage for traces, proposals, execution, and audit history
- authentication and role-based access control
- connector allowlists and scoped permissions
- production monitoring and rollback controls
- validated model output and auditable decision logging

## 11.4 Hackathon Demo Path

Use this sequence for a live demo:

1. Start with `npm run demo:dev`.
2. Select `IT access requests` for the default story.
3. Click `Load Scenario`.
4. Click `Analyze` and point out the graph, patterns, and bottleneck.
5. Click `Generate Proposal` and review the governed plan.
6. Click `Approve`.
7. Click `Run Mock` and emphasize that no external system changes.
8. Click `Export Summary` to show portable demo state.
9. Click `Reset` to prove the demo can be replayed.
10. Switch to `Procurement intake` if you want a second scenario.

Short talk track:

"This demo observes messy work traces, builds a live graph, finds repeated patterns, proposes governed automation, simulates it against history, requires human approval, executes safely through mock tools, and persists the result locally."

## 11.5 Verification Commands

Use these exact commands:

```powershell
npm install
npm run demo:dev
npm run verify:demo
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:preview
npm run typecheck:e2e
```

If Chromium is not installed:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e:install
```

If browser launch is blocked in the environment, use the non-browser gate plus the preview fallback:

```powershell
npm run verify:demo
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If Playwright still cannot launch, treat the local demo plus `verify:demo` as the fallback hackathon readiness check and record the browser blocker in the handoff.
