# Frontend UI Overhaul Task Log

## Decisions

- Made the app landing-first with a `Launch` CTA and a hash-backed `#demo` workspace.
- Applied the Apple-inspired token/premium UI pass with a compact workflow context in the top bar.
- Positioned the landing page as reviewer-first and hackathon-friendly: clear claim, compact preview, and direct entry into the governed workspace.
- Kept the public landing claim explicit: Work Graph Foundry finds repeated patterns in an organization and turns them into governed automation.
- Kept `useWorkGraphDemoController` and the persisted demo state shape unchanged.
- Reduced workspace navigation to `Overview`, `Evidence`, `Graph`, `Review & Run`, and `Audit`.
- Replaced stacked `Plan`, `Govern`, and `Execute` rendering with one reviewer-oriented `Review & Run` surface.
- Demoted approval, execution, export, import, and reset actions into the `Review & Run` and `Audit` views instead of the global shell.
- Removed decorative radial/orb page backgrounds and avoided adding animation libraries.
- Used a code-native product preview on the landing page because no bitmap image generation tool was available in this execution environment.
- Preserved export/import, reset, malformed localStorage recovery, proposal versions, approval/rejection, gated simulation, and mock execution behavior.
- Closed the landing completion gap audit with subagent-owned landing markup, CSS polish, test selector, and live documentation updates.
- Kept main-thread edits limited to small integration fixes after worker review: truthful provider wording, connected preview path styling, unique `Launch` selector safety, and task-log correction.

## Files Changed

- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/styles.css`
- `src/App.test.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/golden-demo.e2e.ts`
- `README.md`
- `docs/01-overview.md`
- `docs/06-testing-and-validation.md`
- `docs/10-demo-operations.md`
- `docs/11-hackathon-demo.md`
- `tasks.md`

## Refinement Pass

- Worker ownership: one `worker_nano` handled the app UI refinement slice; a second `worker_nano` handled tests, docs, and task-log updates.
- Audit decision: app source edits were intentionally scoped to landing copy, reviewer strip simplification, view heading clarity, and supporting CSS.
- Test update scope: loosened the reviewer status-strip checks so they rely on stable scenario, current stage, and execution gate text instead of the old noisy multi-pill set.
- Demo behavior preserved: `#demo`, scenario selection, load/analyze/proposal/review/run/export/reset, rejection gating, import/export, and golden-path recovery remain unchanged.
- Browser/performance expectation: keep the existing Playwright golden path and long-task budget behavior intact; the refinement pass should not introduce layout or execution regressions.
- Remaining risks: some assertions now depend on shell-context copy (`Scenario:`, `Current step:`, `Execution gate:`) and may need adjustment if that non-functional text changes again.

## Audit Decisions

- Kept archived docs untouched because no live doc pointed at stale archived instructions.
- Updated only live docs that directly describe the landing CTA, reviewer-first positioning, or demo walkthrough language.
- Left domain logic, fixtures, persistence, and controller contracts unchanged.

## Component Rationalization

- Kept: domain controller, shell workflow controls, status pills, evidence view, graph view, audit/export/import view.
- Merged: proposal, simulation, governance, execution, and learning loop into `Review & Run`.
- Removed from active UI and source: old dashboard metric grid, overview checklist, repeated Plan/Govern/Execute view headings, unused Plan/Govern/Execute view files, and unused `MetricCard`.

## Verification Log

- Landing completion follow-up:
  - `worker_nano A` owned landing markup/copy in `src/App.tsx`: unique primary `Launch`, static customer-facing copy, explicit workflow blocks, final proof band, and preview-flow structure.
  - `worker_nano B` owned CSS polish in `src/styles.css`: true three-card landing grid, proof-band styling, stale landing CSS removal, run-button shared states, and graph crowding reduction.
  - `worker_nano C` owned selector/doc/task tracking updates across `src/App.test.tsx`, `tests/e2e/golden-demo.e2e.ts`, README, live docs, and `tasks.md`.
  - Main thread reviewed worker patches and applied small integration fixes for provider-safe preview wording, connected automation path semantics/styling, unique `Launch` selector safety, and final e2e selector correctness.
  - Files changed in this pass: `src/App.tsx`, `src/styles.css`, `src/App.test.tsx`, `tests/e2e/golden-demo.e2e.ts`, `README.md`, `docs/01-overview.md`, `docs/06-testing-and-validation.md`, `docs/10-demo-operations.md`, `docs/11-hackathon-demo.md`, and `tasks.md`.
  - Commands run in this pass: repository file inspection, landing selector scan, docs scan, UI diff review, stale CSS/provider scans, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck:e2e`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:demo`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run test:e2e:preview`, animation-library scan, and `git diff --check`.
  - `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck:e2e`, `npm run build`, and `npm run verify:demo` passed.
  - `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run test:e2e:preview` still fail before app assertions because Playwright cannot launch Chromium in this environment: `browserType.launch: spawn EPERM`.
  - In-app Browser QA against the production build passed landing identity, single visible `Launch`, three equal workflow cards, connected automation path, final proof band, zero default-width horizontal overflow, `Launch` to `#demo`, load/analyze/proposal/approve/run/export/reset visible behavior, and empty warning/error console logs.
  - Browser viewport override did not resize the in-app browser during this pass, so 768px/390px/375px responsive validation remains covered by the Playwright test definitions but blocked locally by Chromium `spawn EPERM`.
  - Animation library scan found no `framer-motion`, `gsap`, or `animejs`; the only `motion` match was the existing `prefers-reduced-motion` rule.
  - Remaining risk: local Playwright browser execution needs the Windows Chromium permission issue resolved before the e2e responsive and long-task suites can complete in this environment.
- Apple-inspired UI pass:
  - `worker_nano A` owned the landing copy and code-native product preview update in `src/App.tsx`.
  - `worker_nano B` owned the shell/design-system CSS pass in `src/app/AppShell.tsx` and `src/styles.css`.
  - Main thread resolved the small integration gap by moving `Reset workflow state` into `Audit` and adding compact `Workflow context` text in the top bar.
  - `worker_nano C` updated unit/e2e selectors and live docs for `Workflow context`, view-level `Review & Run` governance actions, and `Audit` export/import/reset actions.
  - `worker_test` verified `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck:e2e`, `npm run build`, and `npm run verify:demo` successfully.
  - `worker_test` ran `npm run test:e2e:install`; `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run test:e2e:preview` were still blocked before app assertions by Chromium `spawn EPERM` from the local Playwright headless shell.
  - Main thread reran `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck:e2e`, and `npm run build`; all passed.
  - Main thread scanned `src/styles.css` for `backdrop-filter`, `radial-gradient`, `--text-kpi`, `text-align: right`, and `text-transform: uppercase`; the final scan returned no matches.
  - Main thread used the in-app Browser against a production build served by a temporary in-session static server. Browser smoke passed landing identity, `Launch` to `#demo`, workflow context, load/analyze/proposal, approval-gated run, Audit export, Audit reset, and empty console warning/error logs.
  - Browser responsive overflow checks passed at 1440px, 768px, 390px, and 375px for both the landing page and launched workspace with zero horizontal overflow.
  - Production build output was removed after verification because `dist/` is ignored generated output.
- Commands run so far:
  - CTA copy scan over README, numbered docs, tests, source, and `tasks.md`
  - `Get-Content src/App.test.tsx`
  - `Get-Content tests/e2e/golden-demo.e2e.ts`
  - `Get-Content src/features/review-run/ReviewRunView.tsx`
  - `Get-Content README.md`
  - `Get-Content docs/01-overview.md`

  - `Get-Content docs/11-hackathon-demo.md`
- `npm run typecheck` passed after the UI refinement and integration cleanup.
- `npm test` passed after the e2e selector cleanup: 10 test files, 41 tests.
- `npm run build` passed after the UI refinement.
- `npm run verify:demo` passed after the final integration cleanup: typecheck, Vitest, production build, and `npm audit --audit-level=low` all passed with 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm run typecheck:e2e` passed after the e2e selector cleanup.
- `npm run test:e2e` initially failed in the sandbox because Chromium launch was blocked with `spawn EPERM`; rerunning outside the sandbox launched Chromium successfully.
- `npm run test:e2e` then failed because stale selectors expected exact scenario text while the refined shell rendered `Scenario: ...`; updated the e2e helper to assert the reviewer status text.
- `npm run test:e2e` passed after the selector fix: 12 Chromium tests.
- `npm run test:e2e:preview` initially hit the same sandbox launch blocker and stale selector issue; after the selector fix and elevated browser launch it passed: 12 Chromium tests.
- `npm run test:e2e:install` was not run because Chromium was already installed.
- `rg "framer-motion|gsap|animejs" package.json package-lock.json src` returned no matches, confirming no animation library was added.
- Browser/IAB path was tested after reading the Browser skill. Shell-launched background dev/static servers exited in this environment, so the built `dist` app was served through a temporary in-session static server and opened in the in-app Browser.
- Browser/IAB checks passed for page identity, nonblank landing page, `Launch` transition to `#demo`, reviewer status strip, load/analyze/proposal/approve/run workflow state, Audit export, no warn/error console logs, and mobile overflow at 390px/375px effective viewport width.
- Browser/IAB screenshot evidence captured the mobile landing page with the `Launch` CTA, product claim, and `Pattern found -> Automation proposal -> Safe run` preview.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm test` initially failed after the route change because tests still assumed workspace-first state; updated tests to launch the demo and load workflow explicitly.
- `npm test` passed after fixes: 10 test files, 41 tests.
- `npm run verify:demo` passed typecheck, Vitest, and production build. The bundled `npm audit --audit-level=low` step failed in the sandbox because the registry audit endpoint returned an error.
- `npm audit --audit-level=low` passed outside the sandbox with 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm run typecheck:e2e` passed.
- `npm run test:e2e` passed: 12 Chromium tests.
- `npm run test:e2e:preview` passed: 12 Chromium tests.
- After deleting the unused Plan/Govern/Execute view files and unused `.dashboard-grid` CSS, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck:e2e`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm run test:e2e:preview` all passed again.
- Browser plugin was attempted first for live QA, but the active tab was blocked by the Browser Use URL policy after entering an internal browser error state. Playwright was used as the safer fallback with the repository's configured local app servers.
- Viewport QA passed at 1440px desktop, 768px tablet, 390px mobile, and 375px small mobile. Each viewport checks the landing page, launches the workspace, runs the demo path, and asserts no horizontal overflow.
- Performance smoke passed in dev and preview runs. The test monitors browser Long Task entries during `Launch`, view switching, graph review, proposal generation, approval, and run interactions, and found no tasks at or above the 200ms budget.
- Console/page error monitoring passed across the Playwright e2e suite.
- Production build output succeeded with no added animation library.
- `worker_nano` owned the GitHub Pages deployment cleanup. The workflow now uses the repository name for `VITE_BASE_PATH` and current Pages action majors: `configure-pages@v6`, `upload-pages-artifact@v5`, and `deploy-pages@v5`.
- Copilot recommendation applied as an artifact sanity check after `npm run build`; if deploy still fails after artifact upload, the remaining issue is GitHub Pages hosted deployment/repo Pages settings, not local Vite output.
- The failed GitHub Pages run was checked through public GitHub Actions metadata and the user-provided log. Build, artifact upload, and deployment creation succeeded; the failure occurred while polling the Pages deployment status from `actions/deploy-pages@v4`.
- The next failed run after the Pages action bump also passed build, tests, Pages configuration, and artifact upload, then failed only at the hosted `Deploy to GitHub Pages` step with GitHub's generic `Deployment failed, try again later.` annotation.
- Public Pages metadata for the repository still returns `404 Not Found`, so repo Pages enablement/source settings remain the likely external blocker if the diagnostic workflow continues to fail.
- A Pages-path build simulation passed with `VITE_BASE_PATH=/Work-Graph-Foundry/`; `dist/index.html` referenced CSS and JS under `/Work-Graph-Foundry/assets/...`.
- `worker_test` verified `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, the Pages-path build simulation, `git diff --check`, and `git status --short`.
- Ignored generated artifacts were cleaned after verification: `dist/`, `test-results/`, `tmp/`, and local server `*.log` files. `git ls-files` confirmed none were tracked before deletion.

## Remaining Risks

- Unsandboxed Playwright and audit commands print a non-project PowerShell profile warning from `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`; the tested commands still exit successfully.
- Browser/IAB testing completed through the built app served by a temporary in-session static server. Full responsive matrix and long-task smoke remain covered by Playwright automation.
- GitHub Pages deployment now derives the Vite base path from the repository name, which avoids hardcoded-path drift if the repo is renamed.
- `docs/06-testing-and-validation.md` now reflects the current `npm test` baseline of 41 tests.
- The Pages deploy failure was isolated to `actions/deploy-pages` after artifact upload; workflow actions were bumped to the current Node-24-compatible majors (`configure-pages@v6`, `upload-pages-artifact@v5`, `deploy-pages@v5`).
- The real GitHub Pages deployment still needs a fresh CI run after commit/push or manual workflow dispatch; local checks cannot complete GitHub's hosted Pages deployment step.
- If the next run still fails after the new artifact sanity check passes, GitHub Pages must be enabled for custom workflows in repository settings, or by an admin through the Pages API/settings UI.
